Updated: 2026-10-07 19:05 SAST

## CURRENT CHECKPOINT
- Continue from this file; preserve existing store and do not rebuild unnecessarily.
- User requires execution-focused progress and handover updates after every task attempt.
- Axxess remains excluded from all remaining tasks for the current 24-hour exclusion window.

## VERIFIED PRODUCTION STATE
- Repository: getwiredautoworx-max/get-wired-autoworx-store, branch main.
- Canonical customer domain: www.getwiredauto.co.za.
- Supabase project: ojytykqpvonxvepprgbh.
- Active products: 4,187.
- Active priced/unique SKUs: 4,187.
- Active units: 27,745.
- Uncategorized active products: 0.
- Pricing mismatches: 0.
- Pricing formula: supplier cost × 1.15 VAT × 1.35 markup.
- Pickup: R0. Packaging: R25/item. Delivery: actual Courier Guy/PAXI quotation subject to quotation.
- No real customer order has been created during QA.

## AUTOMATED STORE QA
- [x] Storefront smoke test SUCCESS: run 37644253627, commit be2529b3fa0350bbe1c93f599f89c1b05232d51d.
- [x] Catalogue Image Audit SUCCESS on same commit.
- [x] Public SKU Exposure Audit SUCCESS on same commit.
- [x] Checkout delivery-fee server validation hardened.
- [x] shipping-quote Edge Function ACTIVE v2.
- [ ] Live HTTP/browser checkout test remains deferred until Axxess/DNS work is permitted.

## OWNER APK — LATEST RUN
- Package: za.co.getwiredautoworx.owner.
- Version baseline: v1.0.1 / versionCode 2; compile/target SDK 35.
- Run #48: 37658519204.
- [x] Build job 112919742928 = SUCCESS.
- [x] Signed-release job 112920419830 = SUCCESS.
- [x] Signed-release artifact: get-wired-owner-signed-release, artifact ID 11500252099.

- [ ] Emulator job 112920419890 is STILL IN PROGRESS at this checkpoint; therefore Run #48 is not yet terminal-successful.
- [ ] Physical Android-device installation/acceptance remains owner-input.
- [ ] Permanent owner-controlled production signing identity remains owner-input; current CI release uses a temporary generated keystore and no signing secret was committed.
- [x] Previous signing failures resolved: JKS keystore format and explicit Android SDK Build Tools apksigner path.
- [x] No Axxess work performed.

## SECURITY
- [x] All seven production tables remain RLS-enabled.
- [x] Public SECURITY DEFINER functions have EXECUTE denied to anon/authenticated/PUBLIC.
- [x] Security Advisor rechecked; only remaining warning is Leaked Password Protection Disabled.
- [ ] Enable leaked-password protection through authorised Supabase Auth configuration when an available authorised path exists.
- [x] Performance advisor only shows informational unused-index notices; no indexes removed blindly.

## PROJECT RULES
1. Preserve existing store as foundation; do not rebuild unnecessarily or overwrite working components.
2. Execute efficiently in one flow; complete all available tasks instead of stopping after every individual step.
3. Only interrupt when genuinely necessary; notify user when input/approval/credentials/permissions are actually required.
4. The 8 rules are permanent; read at start of every continuation session and carry into every new handover.
5. All 8 rules must be copied unchanged into every new handover; may not be omitted/edited/removed without permission. If rules themselves edited/removed, reproduce all 8 first.
6. Do not use Cloudflare or Netlify credits until final testing; reserve credit-dependent work for end-stage testing/deployment.
7. Update master handover after every successfully completed task so next session continues from exact current state.
8. Maintain project continuity and authority; existing work, decisions, data, structure and approved requirements remain in force unless user explicitly authorizes change; do not assume changes that could interfere with online store.

## CONTINUATION INSTRUCTION
Poll Run #48 emulator job until terminal. If successful, verify artifact and update both handovers. If failed, retrieve logs, diagnose, fix and rerun. Then continue the next independent automated task without Axxess.
